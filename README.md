=================

This started as a simple tool I used to do some monotonous work.
It has evolved into a full blown code-editor.
I have not really found one a really liked.
Most of its features will gopefully use third party libaries.

A Text Cleanup Tool for Programmers to Use, Still in Early beta. Programmed in MS C# 5  
but will be ported using mono at some point.
Right Now all it will be able to do is edit a file line by line using 
hard coded rules since I built the initial tool for a specific project.
